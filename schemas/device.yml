  description: >
    network, security, or application device used to detect, observe, or create network, security, or application-related events and metrics. This could be a custom hardware appliance or a server that has been configured to run special network, security, or application software. Examples include firewalls, Intrusion detection/prevention systems, network monitoring sensors, web application firewalls, data loss prevention systems, and APM servers. In ECS, a device is not a host. The device.* fields shall be populated with details of the device, if any, that performs, observes and/or reports a network, security, or application event or metric. Network layer components in the path between the host/device and the Elastic Stack, such as routers, switches, and other network hops are not considered devices in ECS. Message queues and ETL components used in processing events or metrics are not considered devices in ECS.
